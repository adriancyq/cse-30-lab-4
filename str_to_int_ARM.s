	@ R4: char at index 
	@ R5: sum
	@ R6: digit 
	@ R10: str 
	@ R11: dest 

    @ We need to save away a bunch of registers

    @ Get the length of the string 
    MOV R0, R10

    @ For loop to iterate through string 
    MOV R3, #0 

    @ Initialize sum

	@ TODO Check that char falls in range of ASCII digits

	@ Convert char to int 
	SUB R6, R4, #48

	@ Add to sum
	MUL R5, R5, #10
	ADD R5, R5, R6

	@ Go to next element
